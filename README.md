# AFRICOM Flood Simulation Project

This project aims to simulate the flooding areas for AFRICOM across four bases in Niger, Djibouti, and Manda Bay. As a research assistant, my role involves conducting data QAQC (Quality Assurance and Quality Control), analyzing and verifying potential data, and producing cartographic outputs.                                                           |

## Analyzing and Verifying Potential Data

This step involves checking the necessary data provided by AFRICOM to UMN team. The goal is to ensure that the data meets the project's requirements and to provide an overview of data quality and usability to the team. This process includes:

- **Reviewing Data Completeness:** Ensuring that all required data attributes and relationships are present.
- **Cross bases evaluation:** To check if the data included in four bases.

## Cartography

As part of the cartographic responsibilities, the following maps are produced:

- **Base Maps:** Creating detailed base maps with essential data layers such as topography, infrastructure, and key geographical features.
- **Overview Maps for Bases:** Generating overview maps for each of the AFRICOM bases to provide a visual context of the areas involved in the flood simulation.
